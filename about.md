    <p>Hello, I'm Charisse. Welcome to my blog!</p>

    <p>
        I'm a web developer currently based in Berlin.
        My goal is to help create useful and intuitive interfaces
        all while making sure my code is nice and clean. Along the way,
        I share what I'm learning through this blog. It's been a hell of a ride since
        I first started learning how to code while working in my family's coffee shop in Italy,
        and I love every single part of it!
    </p>

    <p>Aside from coding, I...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>love going to the bulk store.</li>
        <li>draw on the biggest paper I can find while listening to medieval fantasy audiobooks</li>
        <li>Or sometimes I write my own novels because why not? I wrote about 8 novels throughout my life
            and I plan on publishing at least one of them in a couple years.
        </li>
        <li>go outside! The area I live in is lined with green patches that leads to a forest.
            Whether I'm going for a run or just taking a short breather, nothing beats a couple hours spent around nature.
        </li>
        <li>Attend meetups</li>
        <li>Read, read, read! You'll find me with my head down
            on a book or online article on the train.
        </li>
        <li>volunteer in food-saving drives. This is something I'd like to start doing, actually. When I adopted the Zero Waste lifestyle,
            I realized that there are so many communities out there trying to save good food from being thrown into the trash either by
            giving it away or cooking it and feeding others. I want to become a part of this.
        </li>
    </ul>
